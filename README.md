This project is very special to me, cause it was my first contact with HTML & CSS.
If you analyse the code, you may notice my lack of domain in those languages back then, but it makes me feel happy to see the amount of improvement I have since then.

We don't need screenshots, 'cause it is online!!!
Another reason to enjoy to  much this project, it was my first deploy of something... Even it is small, i love it!

You can check by yourself in the link bellow. Have fun!! I certainlly has, while i was coding... ðŸ˜„

# PersonalPage - My Coding Journey Debut 🚀
This project holds a special place in my coding journey—it marks my initial exploration into the realms of HTML and CSS. While the code may reveal my early learning curve in these languages, it brings me immense joy to witness the substantial progress I've made since then.

No need for screenshots—this project is live online! It represents my inaugural deployment, a small yet cherished accomplishment.

Feel free to explore it yourself at the link below. Have fun! I certainly did while coding it. 😄
